Most of the time, we donâ€™t have access to the GUI of Google Drive, and we need to upload data to our Drive, such as when using Virtual Machines on the Cloud. Godrive is a tool that allows users to directly upload directories/files to Google Drive from any machine.

Installation
To install this tool, simply run:
```sh
pip install godrive
```

Available Commands
Once installed, you can use the following commands:
```sh
godrive version        #1.0.xx
godrive info           #Dev info
godrive                #To Upload Data
```

Getting Started
After running the command:
```sh
godrive
```
You need to paste the content of client_secrets.json.

How to Get client_secrets.json?

In Browser, go to :
```sh
console.developers.google.com
```
